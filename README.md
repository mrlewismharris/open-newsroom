Open Newsroom for OBS

## Still WIP
An "Open Newsroom" app, will have advanced features to create complex prefab templates to display on the OBS stream. Still extremely early so please don't expect anything too serious yet!

Watch this space!

## Todo:
* Server Console implementation
  * Get the sent text + commands to show within the console
    * May require to swap the container with <p> elements with a textarea instead :/
  * Instant preview in a popper the available console commands
* Get current scene and display on "/obs" page on refresh
* Add "save scene" to save scenes and their info to text file
* Start working on general UI (sketching)
* Logging for server events
